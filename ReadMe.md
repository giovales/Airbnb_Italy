# 🌍 About

This project was proposed by the Data Glow Up initiative from Heitor Sasaki. The idea is to show the growing popularity of short-term rentals and the importance of understanding consumer behavior to maximize guest satisfaction and host revenue.

# 📊 Dataset

The open data is from the Inside Airbnb website. The files have detailed listings, reviews, and calendar data. I used the listings and reviews files for visualization. You can find the data I used and more in the following link: https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

# 📝 Project Steps

1. **Web Scraping**:
    - Tool: Jupyter Notebook
    - Data Source: Inside Airbnb website
    - Output: Raw data (CSV, JSON, etc.)

2. **Data Cleaning and Processing**:
    - Tool: Jupyter Notebook
    - Input: Raw data from the web scraping stage
    - Processes: Data cleaning, transformation, and validation
    - Output: Cleaned data (DataFrame)

3. **Database Creation**:
    - Tool: Jupyter Notebook
    - Database: SQLite
    - Input: Cleaned data
    - Process: Create and populate database tables
    - Output: SQLite database file (.db)

4. **Data Visualization**:
    - Tool: Power BI
    - Input: SQLite database
    - Process: Connect to database, create visualizations and dashboard
    - Output: Interactive visualization
