# 🌍 About

This project was proposed by the Data Glow Up initiative from Heitor Sasaki. The idea is to navigate through Italian cities on the map and analyze the number of Airbnbs available, average price and scores for each room type, number of hosts and superhosts, etc. I'm also bringing a short analysis of the boom of new Airbnb hosts in Italy.

# 📊 Dataset

The open data is from the Inside Airbnb website. The files have detailed listings, reviews, and calendar data. I used the listings and reviews files for visualization. You can find the data I used and more in the following link: https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

# 📝 Project Steps

1. **Web Scraping**:
    - Tool: Jupyter Notebook
    - Data Source: Inside Airbnb website
    - Output: Raw data (CSV, JSON, etc.)

2. **Data Cleaning and Processing**:
    - Tool: Jupyter Notebook
    - Input: Raw data from the web scraping stage
    - Processes: Data cleaning, transformation, and validation
    - Output: Cleaned data (DataFrame)

3. **Database Creation**:
    - Tool: Jupyter Notebook
    - Database: SQLite
    - Input: Cleaned data
    - Process: Create and populate database tables
    - Output: SQLite database file (.db)

4. **Data Visualization**:
    - Tool: Power BI
    - Input: SQLite database
    - Process: Connect to database, create visualizations and dashboard
    - Output: Interactive visualization
